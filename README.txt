ZXTombstone - 2019/10/20 - Morroco

Once again, this is a new remake of my favorite game : Tombstone City.
After adapting and porting it to different operating systems (Windows, Linux, Nintendo DS) 
and several graphics libraries (Allegro, SDL, PA LIB, SFML), I decided to make something special:
Mixing TI99/4A and ZX Spectrum worlds.
This is now done.

So, this Tombstone City game implementation is for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K.
It ran successfully on emulators (My own version and EightyOne) and of course on a real host.
